Main Menu
1.Add New Employee
2. Delete an Employee
3. Update Employee Information
4. Search for an Employee
5. Quit
Please enter your choice 1..5 :

You should use class definition Employeeand class definition HRM. Note that in class Employee, setting the values for all fields is not possible. 
You have to calculate the value for the field “annualSalary” after initializing the fields “workingHours” ,“costPerHour” and “deduction”by user. 
For those which the set function works, the validity of the entered data should be checked. For example, negative values for fields “annualSalary”, 
”workingHours”,”costPerHour” and “deduction”are not accepted. As another example the field “workingHours” should be between 1 and 60.

Class Employee should include following private fields:
    •employeeID (Integer)
    •firstName (String)
    •lastName (String)
    •workingHours (Float)
    •costPerHour (Float) fdlo dwd whd wdwj yu dwh sh swh scsdw fjhef s c kk cjsc sic csjcsc scj 
    •annualSalary(Double)

Class Employee should have member functions for setting and getting the private fields. Member functions should have the following naming style:
    •set_fieldName()
    •get_fieldName()
Note: FieldName is FirstName or LastName ......etc.
The field “employeeID” of class Employee should be unique and auto-increment with the initial value of 1001 for the first employee. It means that 
user should not enter the value for “employeeID”.

Class HRM should include following public fields: 
    •Array ofemployees with the type Employee
    •The actual number of employees which is stored in Array of Employees

Class HRM should include following public member functions:
    •addEmployee(...)
    •deleteEmployee(...)
    •updateEmployee(...)
    •searchEmployee(...)
Your program should read the first 5 employees from text file named “employee.txt”.
Please note that you need to check the actual amount of employees and in case of reaching to the number 100 for the total number of employees you 
should give proper message. For the actual amount of employees you should not enter the value yourself and your program should calculate automatically 
the amount while entering or deleting the information of an employee.
Based on the description of the program, you need to define some arguments for functions 
deleteEmployee(...), 
updateEmployee(...),
searchEmployee(...)

1. AddEmployee() 
This function allows users to enter the related information of employees in class HRM. During the initialization step your program should get the 
working hours per week (e.g. 35) for the employee and the payment for his/her work per hour, and the amount of deduction.Then, you should calculate 
the annualsalary. You should consider 52 working weeks for oneyear in your calculations.
Following is the sample output of this function.

    Please enter the first name of an employee? Alex
    Please enter the last name of an employee? Peterson
    How many hours a week is his/her work? 35
    How much per hour is his/her wage? 20
    How much total deduction? 115

The employee with the following information has been added to the system:
EmployeeID First Name Last Name Salary per year ($)
-------------------------------------------------------
1001        Alex       Peterson   30,420.00

Do you want to add another employee (y/n)? n

2.deleteEmployee(...)
This function allows user to delete the employee information. Since the only unique value inthe list of employees is “Employee ID”, therefore delete 
function should be based on this field. Note that in order to enter the correct Employee ID of employee you need to find his/her Employee ID using the 
function searchEmployee(...).

    Please enter the employee ID? 2425374
    Sorry, there is not any employee with this ID. 
    Do you want to repeat delete by entering new employee ID(y/n)? y
    Please enter the employee ID? 1079
    Do you really want to delete employee Michael Jackson (y/n)? y
    The employee Michael Jackson has been deleted. 
    Do you want to repeat delete by entering new employee ID(y/n)? n

3. updateEmployee(...)
This function allows user to make changes on information of all fields the except the field “Employee ID” is not allowed to be changed. For example, 
if user wants to change the number of working hours for specific employee, he should use this function. Since the only unique value in the list of 
employees is “Employee ID”, therefore update function should be based on this field. Note that during the update process, if user changes fields 
“working hours” or “deduction”, you need to re-calculate yearly salary based on new values and update related fields.

    Please enter the employee ID? 2425374
    Sorry, there is no employee with this ID?
    Do you want to repeat update by entering new employee ID(y/n)? y
    Please enter employee ID? 1001
    Please enter the related number of field which you would like to update?
    (1. First name, 2. Family name, 3. Working hours per week, 4. Payment for one hour, 5. deduction)? 4
    Please enter new payment for one hour in $ for Mr. Peterson? 25
    Do you want to update any other field (y/n)? n
    The information for Mr. Peterson has been updated. 
    Do you want to repeat update by entering new employee ID(y/n)? n

4. searchEmployee(...)
In this function, user can find specific employee using employee ID field.
 
    Please enter the employee ID? 1003
    Employee ID First Name Family Name Annual salary
    -------------------------------------------------
    1003        Martin      Klein        81,900.00

    Do you want to do new search (y/n)? y
    Please enter the employee ID? 1001
    Employee ID First Name Family Name Annualsalary
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    1001    Alex        Peterson        45,500.00

    Do you want to do new search (y/n)? n
